## About me:
Even though I'm still learning about coding, I really enjoy seeing designs come to life. I'm determined to grow more in this area. I'm also a fan of reading and creating my own stories. I'm very fond of the magical worlds that Rowling, Tolkien  and Jones have created and I believe in the beauty of good magic.
